# brainstorm
Concept: 
- 'Organise My Own Weekly Meal Plan'
- 'Generate a Shopping List'

Ethical considerations/societal impact:
- app is not currently using publicly available data
- no senstiive, unique or personal information is being collected from users or used in app
= therefore, minimal negative risk of societal impact

Outcomes for MVP:
- take user input
- user can create custom ingredients
- user can create custom meals
- return a restaurant suggestion based on input 
  - Include restaurant trading name, address, type of food
  
Outside MVP if time: 
- how expensive e.g. $$ vs $$$ (5 scale?)
- rating (Based on review?) e.g. 5 stars? 
- dietary options / preferences e.g. Halal, gluten free, vego
- random may repeat, how to deal with this? Decided to keep out of MVP but pursue if completed
Notes from rubric meeting (info not clear from rubric):
- 5 mins EXCL. questions
- 80% should be app walk through (checkâ€”in slide deck or live demo??)
- take screenshots of convos in slack / Trello and put in here
- record all working notes in here
